Description: I have created the infrastructure for a basic three-tier architecture, including a VPC, public and private subnets, EC2 instances for each tier, and security groups. This is just a starting point, and you should be able to adapt it based on your project's needs.

Step 1: Set up Your Terraform Configuration Files
Create a directory for your Terraform project and create the following configuration files:
main.tf - Main Terraform configuration.
variables.tf - Define input variables.
outputs.tf - Define outputs for your resources.

Step 2: Define the Terraform Configuration
I have provided a simplified main.tf.

Step 3: Define Variables and Outputs (variables.tf and outputs.tf)
In variables.tf, define any variables you want to make configurable.
In outputs.tf, define outputs for the resources that you want to access after provisioning.

Step 4: Initialize and Apply the Configuration
Run the following Terraform commands in your project directory.

terraform init, 
terraform apply

Step 5: Review and Modify
After applying the configuration, review the AWS Console to ensure the resources match your requirements. Modify the Terraform configuration as needed to add more tiers, security configurations, scaling options, and so on.
